# DongDong2

As part of the team project for the Mobile Programming course of Gachon University, this application was developed with the aim of supporting student clubs.

While there is a club promotion board within Everytime (a university community platform), to view detailed information about the club, users had to click and read lengthy posts.

We identified this as an area for improvement and implemented a feature that allows users to quickly understand what the club is about at a glance.

Through this application, we hope to successfully support students' club activities.

## Function
### Signup

* Check for duplicate UserID
It is a feature that verifies if an ID exists or not. If an existing ID is found, it prevents its usage, making it unavailable.
* School Authentication
Upon selecting a student ID photo from the gallery and uploading it, the system will analyze the image to verify if the individual is a student of Gachon University. If the person is indeed a student of Gachon University, the authentication process will be considered complete.

The feature allows users to capture and upload their mobile student ID, as shown in the image below, through the Gachon University Smart Campus mobile application. The system then determines whether the user is a student of Gachon University or not.
