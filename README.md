# DongDong2

As part of the team project for the Mobile Programming course of Gachon University, this application was developed with the aim of supporting student clubs.

While there is a club promotion board within Everytime (a university community platform), to view detailed information about the club, users had to click and read lengthy posts.

We identified this as an area for improvement and implemented a feature that allows users to quickly understand what the club is about at a glance.

Through this application, we hope to successfully support students' club activities.
